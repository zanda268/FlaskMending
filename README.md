## Ruined Mending

A spiritual successor to LitharsMending by DigitalZombie: https://github.com/DigitalzombieTLD/LitharsMending

Allows to repair ruined clothing items. It will automatically chose the worst Sewing Kit and then the worst Tackle when restoring clothes.

At the moment, when you go to restore a ruined clothing item, it will just cost 2 clothes but I will have that updated to more realistic values here in a day or two.

Requires:
- ModSettings
